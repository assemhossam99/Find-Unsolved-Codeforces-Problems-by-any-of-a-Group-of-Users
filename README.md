# Find-Unsolved-Codeforces-Problems-by-any-of-a-Group-of-Users
This script takes a list of codeforces users, and saves a file with list of problems that none of this user solved or tried to solve. 
The script also allows the user to filter the output problem by the difficulty range and topic (both are optional).
